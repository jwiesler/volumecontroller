# VolumeController #

![VolumeController Screenshot](./img/VolumeController.png)

This project was created because the default windows audio mixer does not allow simple manipulation of individual audio session,
e.g. restoring a session to its maximum volume is almost impossible as it is not relative but absolute 
and you have to hit the current master volume exactly or the master volume will be increased and all other sessions fitted relatively.

## Features ##
* Show and control sessions of the default audio output device
* Fine control audio volume sliders (scroll steps: normal = 2, shift = 5, control = 1)
* Filter sessions (show and hide inactive sessions).
* Peak meters
* Light weight
* No Windows App, therefore no Windows Store required to install it
